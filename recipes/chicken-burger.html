        <h1>Steps:</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together 3/4 cups rice vinegar, water, sugar, and sesame seeds in a small bowl until sugar is dissolved. Add carrot, cucumber, and red onion, separating onion layers; toss to coat. Chill until ready to use, stirring occasionally to keep vegetables submerged in the brine.</li>
            <li>Whisk together mayonnaise, Thai sweet chile sauce, Sriracha, 1 teaspoon rice vinegar, and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Chill Bang Bang Sauce until ready to use.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
            <li>Toss mushrooms with 1 tablespoon oil. Spread mushrooms out in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Roast mushrooms in the preheated oven for 15 minutes, stirring halfway through. Remove from oven and allow to cool.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook the burgers, set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Place jalape√±o halves, cut side down, and green onions on a baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon oil. </li>
            <li>Broil vegetables until charred, turning halfway through, about 10 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Brush skillet with 1 teaspoon oil and toast brioche buns, cut side down, until lightly browned, 2 to 4 minutes; set aside.</li>
            <li>Lightly whisk eggs and water in a shallow dish. Add panko bread crumbs to a second dish. Gently dip burger patties into egg mixture, letting excess drip off. Press lightly into bread crumbs to coat both sides.</li>
        </ol>
